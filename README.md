# Introduction to Data Science using R

## Recommended Local Computing Resources:
For modules 1 through 3, at a minimal, you should have the followings installed on your personal comptuer:
- **R**: The latest version of R can be found at https://www.r-project.org/
- **RStudio Desktop**: This can be found at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/
If you already have the above software, please make sure that R is 3.4+ and RStudio is 1.0+

## Palmetto Computing Resources:
A version of this workshop (files ended with .ipynb) is designed to take advantage of the new R (3.4.2) on the Palmetto Supercomputer through a browser interface. The goal is to expose workshop participants to not only the capacity of R and RStudio but also to the availability of large-scale computing resources on Palmetto. 

To successfully work with these .ipynb notebooks, please make sure that the following is completed prior to attending the workshop:

- You have a valid account on Palmetto. If you have not had an account on Palmeto before, please fill out an account request form at https://citi.sites.clemson.edu/new-account/. If you are not a faculty member and are not working on any active supervised research project, please select **Educational** as your account type. For **Sponsor's Clemson Email**, you can use the email address of the workshop's instructor. 

This Palmetto's R module also contains access to the RStudio software (1.1.383). To gain access to this software, you will need to satisfy the following condition: 
- You are able to launch graphical applications from inside the Palmetto Supercomputer. Please follow instructions at https://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/palmetto/userguide_basic_usage.html to learn how to log in to Palmetto and https://www.palmetto.clemson.edu/palmetto/userguide_howto_run_graphical_applications.html to learn how to run graphical applications inside Palmetto. 

Using RStudio from inside Palmetto is not required for this workshop.
