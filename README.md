# Introduction to Data Science using R


## Recommended Computing Resources:
The latest version of this workshop is designed to take advantage of the new R/RStudio module (R 3.4.2, RStudio 1.1.383) on the Palmetto Supercomputer. The goal is to expose workshop participants to not only the capacity of R and RStudio but also to the availability of large-scale computing resources on Palmetto.
